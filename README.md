# AbideTogetherSupport
Abide Together is a simple, faith-centered organization app designed for Catholic couples and families who want to stay connected, simplify daily planning, and keep Christ at the center of their home. Instead of juggling multiple apps for calendars, notes, recipes, and prayer, Abide Together brings everything together in one space.
